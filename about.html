                I've been in education for 14 years and have most 
                recently been work as an assistant headteacher in Tower Hamlets.
                At the end of the academic year, I left
                my post in order to pursue a career
                in software development.<br><br>
                I love teaching, but working solely in this
                industry for a long time has led me to wonder
                what else is out there? <br><br>

                Teaching and education leadership has 
                given me a lot of different skills to bring 
                to the world of tech. I was a class teacher and middle leader
                for over 10 years and for the past few years,
                I have worked as a senior leader in charge of 
                a team comprising
                approximately 40 members of staff. 
                    <br><br>
                As a teacher, I gained skills in managing a large
                workload, prioritising tasks to ensure things were done 
                to time. I also gained experience mentoring student teachers
                and newly qualified teachers. As a senior leader, I further
                developed these skills as well as improving my communication,
                organisation, teamwork and leadership skills.

                In January, I decided to begin my journey into 
                the tech world. After completing a short course with 
                the Code Institute, I decided to my knowledge of HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript. <br><br>
                I have worked on a number or projects, planning 
                using a wireframe initially, building a farmework using
                HTML and CSS and then adding interactivity using JavaScript.
                <br><br>
                Having gained a lot of experience solving problems with JavaScript
                through online learning and platforms such as Codewars, these
                projects enabled me to apply these skills to real life projects. 
                See the projects page for examples and look at the Readme files
                for examples of problems I encountered whilst building the sites.
